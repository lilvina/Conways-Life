This week, I built a game called Conways Life in React. What is Conways Life and what is it about? It is a game created by British mathematician named John Horton Conway, a zero player game that interacts with the Game of life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves by creating patterns with properties. Here are the rules for the game:
1.  If the cell is alive and it has exactly 2 or 3 neighbors, it stays alive.
2.  If the cell is alive and it has less than 2 or 4+ neighbors, it will die.
3.  If the cell is dead and it has exactly 3 live neighbors, it comes to life.
I used a tutorial to help me build my game but also implemented my own code. At first, I wasnâ€™t sure if I understood the logic of the game and felt if I was just following the tutorial and not grasping the concept. What made me understood the game was pair programming and being challenged on what my code is doing. For example, I had to explain how the cells are moving. My partner used a matrix algorithm as an example to help me understand why the cells were moving. Once he gave me that analogy, it started to register. The Y cells represents the rows X cells represents the columns and you have a nested for-loop that is going through each array so that the cells can be generated to the board. After that, I was able to get the game to work and it was great to see how each cell was moving and how the cells got bigger whenever they would collide with each other. You can run it as many times as you want and can stop the game and clear the game. Overall, this was a challenging yet fun project to build and it definitely helped me rebuild my knowledge in React.
